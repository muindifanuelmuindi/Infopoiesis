<b>Infopoiesis</b>
<br>
Infopoiesis is a performance method that transforms global statistical datasets into normalized control signals.
These signals donâ€™t directly produce sound. Instead, they act as navigational inputs within a live beat slicing environment.
<br><br>
<b>Concept</b>
<br>
The performer improvises the number and placement of slices, while the datasets determine how the step sequencer advances through those slices.
This creates a hybrid approach that merges structured data logic with embodied improvisation, allowing systemic patterns to be felt rather than merely analyzed.
