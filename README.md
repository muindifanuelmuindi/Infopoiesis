<b>Infopoiesis</b>

Infopoiesis is a performance method that transforms global statistical datasets into normalized control signals.
These signals donâ€™t directly produce sound â€” instead, they act as navigational inputs within a live beat slicing environment.

Concept

The performer improvises the number and placement of slices, while the datasets determine how the step sequencer advances through those slices.
This creates a hybrid approach that merges structured data logic with embodied improvisation, allowing systemic patterns to be felt rather than merely analyzed.
